# Streaming with Redis and NodeJS

This is a demo built using the demo from the RedisConf18 keynote written by Kyle Davis and shows how to use Redis Stream using NodeJS.

This is a technology demo, not a reference architecture nor an example of best practices. While it might be possible to create a usable production system out of the ideas presented, it is not hardened in any way.


## Setup

To setup the demo, you will need Node.js, NPM and your Redis connection information. 

First, install the server-side Node modules with NPM
```
$ npm install
```

The Twitter eater, (in the future, the `terms` argument is the keyword on which the demo will run - it works best with something high volume like politics, sports, etc.) Right now it is hard coded with "trump" as search word.
```
$ node twitter.eater.js
```

Start server.node.js which streams to browser client.

$ node server.node.js


The service will launch on localhost:4000
